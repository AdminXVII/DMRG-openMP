Will update this with steps to compile and run codes in this folder
with Kokkos. 

Stay tuned.

For the time being to run any of these files, replace one of these files with applyHtarget.cpp

In miniappRonnie:

export KOKKOS_PATH=KokkosBuild
cp CMakeLists.txt workingKokkos/CMakeLists.txt
cp applyHtarget.cpp workingKokkos/<any file from this folder>
cd build
cmake ../ (If CMakeFiles have not been generated)
make 

$KOKKOS_PATH/bin/hpcbind -- <command used to run our code--see ../README>
